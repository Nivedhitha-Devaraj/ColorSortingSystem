# ColorSortingSystem
This system detects Red, Green, and Blue objects, moves them via a conveyor belt, and sorts them into bins using a robotic arm. The system outputs 1, 2, or 3 in the display block, indicating the correct bin for each object. 


# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project presents an Automated Color Sorting System using MATLAB and Simulink, designed to identify and sort objects based on their color (Red, Green, or Blue). The system uses a color detection algorithm to process an input image and determines the dominant color. Based on the detected color, a simulated robotic arm places the object into the respective bin — Bin 1 for Red, Bin 2 for Green, and Bin 3 for Blue.

The project is implemented in three main subsystems:

         Conveyor Belt System – Simulates object movement.

         Color Detection System – Extracts RGB values and identifies the object's color.

         Robotic Arm Control System – Directs the object to the correct bin and displays the output.

This simulation demonstrates the application of mechatronics principles, sensor integration, and automated control systems.
